# PD1012-Pill-Notifier
The python file in this repository is the code for a pill dispenser created during Health Hacks 2018 for our group PD1012. The code allows for the pill dispenser (working with a Raspberry Pi) to dispense pills "Skittles" at a timed interval (every 30 seconds or 35 seconds) and to then give the user/patient a text message using the Twilio service.
